I was in a great deal of pain that had me very limited activity. Your company denied the request. I had severe swelling of that leg and lost palpated pulses because of it. I and my doctor were very concerned that I would develop compartment syndrome  and that I would require a facheotomy to regain circulation to my foot.  I felt like time was of the essence. So I finally told my doctor to do the injection even if I had to pay for it out of my savings. I had the injection and my pain and swelling were gone in 24 hours.
